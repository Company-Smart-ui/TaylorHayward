		p Once purchaced, my music is free to use in web based or theater based video projects. Just credit me (Taylor Hayward) and #[a(href="mailto:taylor@taylorhayward.com") email] me a link to your video so I can check it out. It's fun to see where my music is being used. :-)
		p I'm glad you like my music. I hope your video project goes great!
