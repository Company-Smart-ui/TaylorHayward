			p The A&nbsp;Home For Sound album was created in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Brookline, Massachusetts recording studio over the period of&nbsp;two months in&nbsp;the summer of&nbsp;2011.
			p Oceans at&nbsp;Rest is&nbsp;more of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mantra song where one could easily listen to&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the background and be&nbsp;calmed by&nbsp;its simplicity. The other songs are more emotional or&nbsp;melodic in&nbsp;form and will be&nbsp;more likely to&nbsp;draw the listener&rsquo;s attention.
			p My&nbsp;background is&nbsp;in&nbsp;piano as&nbsp;a&nbsp;soloist and I&rsquo;ve been creating unique pieces for the instrument for many years. My&nbsp;style has moved from simple tunes to&nbsp;more complicated ones, and most recently ones that have really opened up&nbsp;emotionally. If&nbsp;you check out my&nbsp;previous music, which you can find on&nbsp;the Recordings page, you&rsquo;ll see the obvious change in&nbsp;time. I&nbsp;hope to&nbsp;continue making great music for years to&nbsp;come. I&nbsp;still have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;formal rules to&nbsp;figure out to&nbsp;progress my&nbsp;music in&nbsp;different directions, which&nbsp;I intend to&nbsp;do, but in&nbsp;the end it&rsquo;s the heart you put into the music that gets conveyed to&nbsp;the listener and I&rsquo;ve always tried to&nbsp;maintain that, and will continue to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so.
